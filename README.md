# OpenCv
Definition of a metal insert for a seal of the "arrow" type. Using the camera's set lighting and OpenCV the program determines the location of the insert.
The program also determines which side the insert fell on - the correct position when the insert fell on a non-protruding part.

# How it works
–êfter the inserts are placed in the camera area, the program waits for the button to be pressed, after which the insert that lies in the desired position will be highlighted with a blue outline
